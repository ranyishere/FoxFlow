# FoxFlow
--------
A statically typed language with a focus on understanding,
and verifying simulations with program semantics as stochastic processes.

DGG is inheritently Turing Complete if we allow infinite Fockspace. This is bad if we care about analysis and static guarantees.


If we allow a finite Fockspace by truncating the number of particles we then get something that we can analyze better.

FoxFlow is a non-turing complete implementation of DGG.


## Analysis
-------
- Density matrix renormalization group.
- Supersymmetric theory of stochastic differential equations.
- Reachability analysis
- Emergent Phenomena analysis
