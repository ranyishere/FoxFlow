# Analyze semantics
# -----------------
# Two nodes, on the left side that share a real valued parameter exactly. This will never happend.
# Check for loops in the graph. (picks algorithm)
# Analyze propensity function?
# Look at stochiometry matrix of each rule to find
# the sign of the loop.
# Record all the loops, and calculate the sign of each feedback loop.
# EX: A + B -> C, C -> A + B
# Does this network have detailed balance?
# Laws of physics (conservation) are time reversable, there they are time reversible.
# Detailed balance makes the algorithm fast.
# Search for subnetworks where detailed balance are possible.
